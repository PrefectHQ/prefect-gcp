The `prefect-gcp` collection makes it easy to leverage the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in your flows, featuring support for Vertex AI, Cloud Run, BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Secret Manager.

## Getting Started

### Saving credentials to a block

You will need to first install [prefect-gcp](#installation) and authenticate with a service account in order to use `prefect-gcp`.

 `prefect-gcp` is able to safely save and load the service account, so they can be reused across the collection! Simply follow the steps below.

1. Refer to the [GCP service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) on how to create and download a service account key file.
2. Copy the JSON contents.
3. Create a short script, replacing the placeholders with your information.

```python
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials

# replace this PLACEHOLDER dict with your own service account info
service_account_info = {
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "PROJECT_ID",
  "private_key_id": "KEY_ID",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nPRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
  "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
}

GcpCredentials(
    service_account_info=service_account_info
).save("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

!!! warning "`service_account_info` vs `service_account_file`"
    
    The advantage of using `service_account_info`, instead of `service_account_file`, is that it is accessible across containers.
    
    If `service_account_file` is used, the provided file path *must be available* in the container executing the flow.

Congrats! You can now easily load the saved block, which holds your credentials:

```python
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials
GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

!!! info "Registering blocks"

    Register blocks in this module to
    [view and edit them](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/blocks/)
    on Prefect Cloud:

    ```bash
    prefect block register -m prefect_gcp
    ```

### Using Prefect with Google Cloud Run

Is your local computer or server running out of memory or taking too long to complete a job?

`prefect_gcp` can offers a solution by enabling you to execute your Prefect flows remotely, on-demand thru Google Cloud Run.

The following code snippets demonstrate how `prefect_gcp` can be used to run a job on Cloud Run, either as part of a Prefect deployment's infrastructure or within a flow.

#### As Infrastructure

Below is a simple walkthrough for how to use Google Cloud Run as infrastructure for a deployment.

##### Set variables

To expedite copy/paste without the needing to update placeholders manually, update and execute the following.

```bash
export CREDENTIALS_BLOCK_NAME="BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER"
export CLOUD_RUN_JOB_BLOCK_NAME="cloud-run-job-example"
export CLOUD_RUN_JOB_REGION="us-central1"
export GCS_BUCKET_BLOCK_NAME="cloud-run-job-bucket-example"
export GCP_PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

##### Build an image

First, find an existing image within the Google Artifact Registry. Ensure it has Python and `prefect-gcp[cloud_storage]` installed, or follow the instructions below to set one up.

Create a `Dockerfile`.

```dockerfile
FROM prefecthq/prefect:2-python3.11
RUN pip install "prefect-gcp[cloud_storage]"
```

Then push to the Google Artifact Registry.

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create test-example-repository --repository-format=docker --location=us
gcloud auth configure-docker us-docker.pkg.dev
docker build -t us-docker.pkg.dev/${GCP_PROJECT_ID}/test-example-repository/prefect-gcp:2-python3.11 .
docker push us-docker.pkg.dev/${GCP_PROJECT_ID}/test-example-repository/prefect-gcp:2-python3.11
```

##### Save an infrastructure and storage block

Save a custom infrastructure and storage block by executing the following snippet.

```python
import os
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials, CloudRunJob, GcsBucket

gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load(os.environ["CREDENTIALS_BLOCK_NAME"])

# must be from GCR and have Python + Prefect
image = f"us-docker.pkg.dev/{os.environ['GCP_PROJECT_ID']}/test-example-repository/prefect-gcp:2-python3.11"  # noqa

cloud_run_job = CloudRunJob(
    image=image,
    credentials=gcp_credentials,
    region=os.environ["CLOUD_RUN_JOB_REGION"],
)
cloud_run_job.save(os.environ["CLOUD_RUN_JOB_BLOCK_NAME"], overwrite=True)

bucket_name = "cloud-run-job-bucket"
cloud_storage_client = gcp_credentials.get_cloud_storage_client()
cloud_storage_client.create_bucket(bucket_name)
gcs_bucket = GcsBucket(
    bucket=bucket_name,
    gcp_credentials=gcp_credentials,
)
gcs_bucket.save(os.environ["GCS_BUCKET_BLOCK_NAME"], overwrite=True)
```

##### Write a flow

Then, use an existing flow to create a deployment with, or use the flow below if you don't have an existing flow handy.

```python
from prefect import flow

@flow(log_prints=True)
def cloud_run_job_flow():
    print("Hello, Prefect!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cloud_run_job_flow()
```

##### Create a deployment

If the script was named "cloud_run_job_script.py", build a deployment manifest with the following command.

```bash
prefect deployment build cloud_run_job_script.py:cloud_run_job_flow \
    -n cloud-run-deployment \
    -ib cloud-run-job/${CLOUD_RUN_JOB_BLOCK_NAME} \
    -sb gcs-bucket/${GCS_BUCKET_BLOCK_NAME}
```

Now apply the deployment!

```bash
prefect deployment apply cloud_run_job_flow-deployment.yaml
```

##### Test the deployment

Start up an agent in a separate terminal. The agent will poll the Prefect API for scheduled flow runs that are ready to run.

```bash
prefect agent start -q 'default'
```

Run the deployment once to test.

```bash
prefect deployment run cloud-run-job-flow/cloud-run-deployment
```

Once the flow run has completed, you will see `Hello, Prefect!` logged in the Prefect UI.

!!! info "No class found for dispatch key"

    If you encounter an error message like `KeyError: "No class found for dispatch key 'cloud-run-job' in registry for type 'Block'."`,
    ensure `prefect-gcp` is installed in the environment that your agent is running!

#### Within Flow

You can execute commands through Cloud Run Job directly within a Prefect flow.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials
from prefect_gcp.cloud_run import CloudRunJob

@flow
def cloud_run_job_flow():
    cloud_run_job = CloudRunJob(
        image="us-docker.pkg.dev/cloudrun/container/job:latest",
        credentials=GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER"),
        region="us-central1",
        command=["echo", "Hello, Prefect!"],
    )
    return cloud_run_job.run()
```

### Using Prefect with Google Vertex AI

`prefect_gcp` can enable you to execute your Prefect flows remotely, on-demand using Google Vertex AI too!

Be sure to additionally [install](#installation) the AI Platform extra!

Setting up a Vertex AI job is extremely similar to setting up a Cloud Run Job, but replace `CloudRunJob` with the following snippet.

```python
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials, VertexAICustomTrainingJob, GcsBucket

gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")

vertex_ai_job = VertexAICustomTrainingJob(
    image="IMAGE-NAME-PLACEHOLDER",  # must be from GCR and have Python + Prefect
    credentials=gcp_credentials,
    region="us-central1",
)
vertex_ai_job.save("test-example")
```

!!! info "Cloud Run Job vs Vertex AI"

    With Vertex AI, you can allocate computational resources on-the-fly for your executions, much like Cloud Run.
    
    However, unlike Cloud Run, you have the flexibility to provision instances with higher CPU, GPU, TPU, and RAM capacities.

    Additionally, jobs can run for up to 7 days, which is significantly longer than the maximum duration allowed on Cloud Run.

### Using Prefect with Google BigQuery

Got big data in BigQuery? `prefect_gcp` allows you to steadily stream data from and write to Google BigQuery within your Prefect flows!

Be sure to [install](#installation) `prefect-gcp` with the BigQuery extra!

The provided code snippet shows how you can use `prefect_gcp` to create a new dataset in BigQuery, define a table, insert rows, and fetch data from the table.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp.bigquery import GcpCredentials, BigQueryWarehouse

@flow
def bigquery_flow():
    all_rows = []
    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")

    client = gcp_credentials.get_bigquery_client()
    client.create_dataset("test_example", exists_ok=True)

    with BigQueryWarehouse(gcp_credentials=gcp_credentials) as warehouse:
        warehouse.execute(
            "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_example.customers (name STRING, address STRING);"
        )
        warehouse.execute_many(
            "INSERT INTO test_example.customers (name, address) VALUES (%(name)s, %(address)s);",
            seq_of_parameters=[
                {"name": "Marvin", "address": "Highway 42"},
                {"name": "Ford", "address": "Highway 42"},
                {"name": "Unknown", "address": "Highway 42"},
            ],
        )
        while True:
            # Repeated fetch* calls using the same operation will
            # skip re-executing and instead return the next set of results
            new_rows = warehouse.fetch_many("SELECT * FROM test_example.customers", size=2)
            if len(new_rows) == 0:
                break
            all_rows.extend(new_rows)
    return all_rows

bigquery_flow()
```

### Using Prefect with Google Cloud Storage

With `prefect_gcp`, you can have peace of mind that your Prefect flows have not only seamlessly uploaded and downloaded objects to Google Cloud Storage, but also have these actions logged.

Be sure to additionally [install](#installation) `prefect-gcp` with the Cloud Storage extra!

The provided code snippet shows how you can use `prefect_gcp` to upload a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket and download the same file under a different file name.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials, GcsBucket


@flow
def cloud_storage_flow():
    # create a dummy file to upload
    file_path = Path("test-example.txt")
    file_path.write_text("Hello, Prefect!")

    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    gcs_bucket = GcsBucket(
        bucket="BUCKET-NAME-PLACEHOLDER",
        gcp_credentials=gcp_credentials
    )

    gcs_bucket_path = gcs_bucket.upload_from_path(file_path)
    downloaded_file_path = gcs_bucket.download_object_to_path(
        gcs_bucket_path, "downloaded-test-example.txt"
    )
    return downloaded_file_path.read_text()


cloud_storage_flow()
```

!!! info "Upload and download directories"

    `GcsBucket` supports uploading and downloading entire directories. To view examples, check out the [Examples Catalog](examples_catalog/#cloud-storage-module)!

### Using Prefect with Google Secret Manager

Do you already have secrets available on Google Secret Manager? There's no need to migrate them!

`prefect_gcp` allows you to read and write secrets with Google Secret Manager within your Prefect flows.

Be sure to [install](#installation) `prefect-gcp` with the Secret Manager extra!

The provided code snippet shows how you can use `prefect_gcp` to write a secret to the Secret Manager, read the secret data, delete the secret, and finally return the secret data.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials, GcpSecret


@flow
def secret_manager_flow():
    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    gcp_secret = GcpSecret(secret_name="test-example", gcp_credentials=gcp_credentials)
    gcp_secret.write_secret(secret_data=b"Hello, Prefect!")
    secret_data = gcp_secret.read_secret()
    gcp_secret.delete_secret()
    return secret_data

secret_manager_flow()
```

### Accessing Google credentials or clients from GcpCredentials

In the case that `prefect-gcp` is missing a feature, feel free to [submit an issue](#feedback).

In the meantime, you may want to access the underlying Google Cloud credentials or clients, which `prefect-gcp` exposes via the `GcpCredentials` block.

The provided code snippet shows how you can use `prefect_gcp` to instantiate a Google Cloud client, like `bigquery.Client`.

Note a `GcpCredentials` object is NOT a valid input to the underlying BigQuery client--use the `get_credentials_from_service_account` method to access and pass an actual `google.auth.Credentials` object.

```python
import google.cloud.bigquery
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials

@flow
def create_bigquery_client():
    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    google_auth_credentials = gcp_credentials.get_credentials_from_service_account()
    bigquery_client = bigquery.Client(credentials=google_auth_credentials)
```

If you simply want to access the underlying client, `prefect-gcp` exposes a `get_client` method from `GcpCredentials`.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials

@flow
def create_bigquery_client():
    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    bigquery_client = gcp_credentials.get_client("bigquery")
```
